#Vectors and Arrays
# a vector is a set of objects of the same simple type. 
#We can make a vector of numbers by putting a set of numbers together using c() function
#c stands for concatenate
x<- c(2, 4.3, 6.6, 10, -1)
x
#various things we might want to do with a vector of numbers
#find length
length(x)
#sort into ascending order
sort(x)
#find its max value
max(x)
#add all the elements up
sum(x)
#prod can multiply all the elements together
prod(x)
#we can use mathematical operations on a vector.
y <- c(1, 4, 2.2, 7.13, sqrt(7))
y
#let's add x + y
#this is an example of element-wise addition - each element of x is added to the corresponding element of y
x + y
#we can compare these vectors, and we either get TRUE/FALSE values
#example to find out which elements of x are larger than the corresponding element of y
x>y
#will output TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE FALSE
#will get an error message if we try to add the 5-element vector x to the 2-element vector z:
z <- c(3, 5)
x + z
#longer object is not a multiple of shorter object length
#R tries to make enough copies of z to match the 5 element length of x
#but 1 copy of z is too short but  3 copies of z are too long
#this example tells use something about what R does when we execute
#add 1.5 to each element in the x vector
x + 1.5
#subtract the minimum value from every element of x
x - min(x)
#here are a few more example making use of this property
2*x + 4.5 - median(x)
#append the value 5.5 onto the end of x-making a vector of 6 elements
v <- c(x, 5.5)
v
#add on z (which has a length 2 - so it is recycled 3 times)
v+z
#vector valued functions
range(x)
#incidentally this is the exact same as:
c(min(x), max(x))
#the diff() function subtracts each element in a vector from the previous element
#the vector it returns is just one element shorter than the one you give it
diff(y)
#Accessing subsets of a vector
#we can extract and select particular elments of a vector
#select first element
x[1]
#select the 4th element
x[4]
#select the last element
x[length(x)]
#a non existent element would return NA
x[10]
#the first and fourth elements
x[c(1,4)]
#using an index vector, we can access the same element multiple times if we want to
x[c(1,1,1,2,1,5,5)]
#R allows us to generate sequences of consecutive integers using the : operator
#1:4 gives us the vector c(1,2,3,4)
#it gives us the first four elements of x
x[1:4]
#we can use range() to check for range
range(x)
#this will output the same thing
idx <- c(which.min(x),which.max(x))
idx
x[idx]
#Here we stored the index vector in an object called idx before we used it.
#Something that is sometimes useful and sometimes annoying is that 
#if the number before the : larger than the one after you get the
#consecutive values in decreasing order. So 2:5 is c(2,3,4,5) and 5:2 is c(5,4,3,2)
# Store the length of x
n <- length(x)
# Store the set of integers from n down to 1
idx <- n:1
idx
# Get the elements of x in reverse order
x[idx]
#continue at rev(x) part
#Special values
#Not Available, NA is used to represent a value that is missing, in other words, 'Not available'
#example, we might have vector of cities, but not know the values
populations <- cities <- c(Auckland=1495000, Wellington=405000,
                           Christchurch=389700, Dunedin=NA)
populations
#we can convert populations into millions. Any math operation of an NA results in NA again
populations/100000
#we can compare populations to the size of wellington, which cities are bigger?
populations>populations["Wellington"]
#if we want to find out if a value is NA, we can't use the == comparison
populations==NA, #this results in all being NA
#we can use is.na() to test whether a value is NA or not
is.na(populations)
#So to find which cities we donâ€™t have a population for:
populations[is.na(populations)]
#and to those we do have a population for, recall that ! flips TRUE and FALSE around
populations[!is.na(populations)]
#NULL values are used in certain contexts to indicate an absence of information
#NaN = not an number
#if we're dealing with real numbers, sqrt(-1) does not exist
sqrt(-1) #results in NaN
#is.nan is similiar function to is.na to test of the output of the code will be NaN
#infinity (inf) is used to represent an infinite value
x <- 1/0
x
#we have both positive and negative infinity, and certain types of arithmetical operations
#will behave as we'd want them to
-1/0
#we can also add to inf
Inf + 5
#comparison of values
Inf>4
-Inf<=27
Inf==Inf
#a really big value
2^700000000000
#and some operations just don tmake sense
Inf-Inf
